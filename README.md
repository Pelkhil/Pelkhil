- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pelkhil
- 👀 I’m run somewhat behind the scenes by Sir John
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and working with pygame to help all of our students create their own video games 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with you all to give you all a place to store your games and help eachother
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm either at my desk in the junior wing (hiding behind the door) or hanging out in the upstair ICT lab. If you can't find me in those places I'm probably out of reach, try to talk to ICT Ma'am.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I LOVE football, maybe we can make a football game?

- I'll be making a more fun Readme for this page if youre interested in helping see me after school!
